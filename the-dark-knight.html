BURNING. Massive flames. A dark shape emerges- The BAT SYMBOL. Growing. Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

How are you peeps doing? It's been a long time since I was here... Let's see... July 2018 (1), August 2018 (2), April 2020 (2), wait, that doesn't seem right, does it? I was gone in 2019! Just cut to the chase dude! Alright alright, calm down your highness... And my 2 previous 2020 posts are not really official, it's just random posts, so please ignore them.
</p>

<p>
So, I realized something new for the <b>Wordpress Android Mobile App</b>, it becomes Dark! (I tried to find a phrase that related to the word Dark, and you know The Dark Knight, so I use it for the title, nothing more nothing less). Say what? Yes, now there is an option to make your app appearance to be light or dark, just like Twitter. You peeps, probably already know that, but I just came back, so bear with me.

...And Then The Problem Appeared
</h3>

<p>
I started to read your posts again. After a while, I noticed that I had difficulty to read a post <a href="https://latifadelina.wordpress.com/2020/05/09/ternyata-blog-juga-ada-award-nya/" target="_blank">Ternyata Blog juga ada Award-nya</a> (if you don't understand, don't worry, you're not going crazy by reading my post, it's just in Indonesian, or my writing is making people crazy?)
</p>

<p>
By the way, I was planning on writing this probably a week ago, and made some paragraphs, but then I felt lazy again and until now I just continue. What make me continue to write this? I saw another post that's hard to read <a href="https://nadyairsalina.wordpress.com/2018/08/19/a-closure/" target="_blank">A Closure</a>.
</p>

<h3>
Apparently You Need To Fix It
</h3>

<p>
I am pretty sure I already knew the reason for this problem. The last time I checked, the first post contains syntax to make the text color black, imagine what happened with that dark background! You already show the image dumbass! Oh, sorry, yeah, as you can see the image earlier.
</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<p>
As you can see, there is a <code>style="color:#000000;"</code> which means that the text is forced to have black color! You don't believe me? Alright let's take a look at one of my post.
</p>

<p>
See, can you find similar code? I am sure there's no similar code, or is there? Let me know if you find one, I am not looking for everything there, hahaha. The thing is my posts having no problem with the Dark appearance so the problem must be the previous code I explained before.

So, How To Fix It?

<p>
Sorry, I am tired, I'll continue later. I am starting to remember why I wasn't writing on 2019.
