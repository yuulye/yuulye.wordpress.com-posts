<q cite="http://www.coolnsmart.com/ex_quotes/">It hurts the worst when the person that made you feel so special yesterday, makes you feel so unwanted today.</q> Everytime I remember about somebody that I used to know. Enough, that's History! Talking about history WordPress post also has it's own history.

After yesterday, now I know that a post can have many history. If you don't already know try to check it from your <b>Blog Posts</b> &rarr; Choose a Post &rarr; Edit. In the top left menu after your site title there are link says <b>History</b>. If you are like me (make changes everytime) You might see histories of your edited post.

<blockquote cite="https://en.support.wordpress.com/editors/page-post-revisions/">The Revisions screen shows any backup copies of your post or page. Each time you save a draft or Update, a revision is saved. WordPress.com will store the last 25 revisions for each post or page on your blog. Revisions allow you to look back at the recent changes you’ve made and revert to an earlier version if necessary.</blockquote>

You might want to see <a href="Editors »Post and Page Revisions">https://en.support.wordpress.com/editors/page-post-revisions/</a> for more detailed information about history in WordPress post. But if you want something else you can keep reading this post, I will talk about <b>file versioning</b>.

I try not to depend on this feature provided by WordPress because the last time problem with HTML entities thing, You can check <a href="https://yuulye.wordpress.com/2017/12/16/be-careful-with-wordpress-editor/">this post</a> to know the details. Now I keep posts in separate place, copy paste to publish it, doesn't sound effective but it's fun and safe for me.

<blockquote cite="https://www.bestbackups.com/blog/6744/5-best-backups-file-versioning/">
<h3>So what is file versioning?</h3>

If you backup files using a program with file versioning, you can go back to drafts of your work that you’ve since saved over. For example, if you deleted a paragraph from a paper a week ago and now you want it back, you can search through all of the previously saved versions of that document until you find a copy that contains the text you’re looking for.

It’s also very useful if your files get corrupted, as you can simply open a version of the document from before it happened and keep working as planned.

Basically this is the same thing like history I talked before but instead of file it's a post versioning. In a more technical term this thing is called <b>version control system</b> <q cite="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later</q>. This is how I usually version my files. Now, let's talk about what version control I use.

<h2>Git &amp; GitHub</h2>

<blockquote cite="https://git-scm.com/">Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://github.com/">GitHub is a development platform inspired by the way you work. From open source to business, you can host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers.</blockquote>

<blockquote cite="https://stackoverflow.com/a/13321586">They are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git.</blockquote>

I will not talk to deep about these two things because theoritically it's really complicated I just know a little in how to use it. I took me years to understand parts by parts of this technology so if You try to mastering these things I suggest You to play it slow don't rush anything. And now, this is how 
I use them.
