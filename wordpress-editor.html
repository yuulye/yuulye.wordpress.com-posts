I just edited a post and it had enough changes to annoy me. What I did was trying to update my last post, I tried to remove this sign <code>&lt;!-- more --&gt;</code>. I removed the sign, update the post, and guess what happened, the post broken.

My post has a lot of HTML tag written inside it, after I reload the content, all of HTML entities become characters. For example: I write <code>&amp;lt;</code>, this should become <code>&lt;</code>, and when the post content reload in the WordPress editor it became the actual character, so no more <code>&amp;lt;</code> but <code>&lt;</code>.

I'm not going to repeat my mistake, so now I need change the way I write post.

<h3>Text Editor</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor">A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software, following the Microsoft Notepad.</blockquote>

I use a desktop computer application to write called text editor. There are tons of text editor out there but the one I use is Sublime Text <q cite="https://www.sublimetext.com/">A sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose</q>. I use this text editor for almost everything, from writing code, searching files, Git, compare texts, and now, writing post for WordPress Blog, and I'm loving it. Why I love it?

<h3>Colors</h3>

This is the same reason why I love writing code, the colors or usually called <b>Syntax highlighting</b>.

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting">Syntax highlighting is a feature of text editors that are used for programming, scripting, or markup languages, such as HTML. The feature displays text, especially source code, in different colors and fonts according to the category of terms. This feature facilitates writing in a structured language such as a programming language or a markup language as both structures and syntax errors are visually distinct. Highlighting does not affect the meaning of the text itself; it is intended only for human readers.</blockquote>

<h3>Distraction Free Mode</h3>

<blockquote cite="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/distraction_free.html">Distraction Free Mode shows your files full screen, with nothing but text shown in the center of your monitor. All UI chrome is hidden, but accessible. Distraction Free Mode can be entered into via the View/Enter Distraction Free Mode menu item.

When in Distraction Free Mode, all UI chrome (side bar, minimap, status bar, etc) will be hidden. You can selectively enable parts of the UI via the View menu - your settings will be remembered next time you enter Distraction Free Mode.</blockquote>

I don't usually work using this feature because I always changing windows, but when writing a post like this it's pretty different, I don't need to change windows as much as when I coding. It make me focus more on what I'm writing.

and the best is,

<h3>VIM Mode</h3>

Like what I was said, I use this text editor a lot, and for everything I always use this VIM mode. In Sublime Text it is called Vintage Mode <q cite="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html">Vintage is a vi mode editing package for Sublime Text 2. It allows you to combine vi's command mode with Sublime Text's features, including multiple selections.</q> actually but I prefer to call it VIM <q cite="http://www.vim.org/">Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X. </q> Because if only I had more strength and power I will be using VIM instead of Sublime Text. This VIM Mode make me move around much faster.

Since now I have the post files in my computer drive, I maybe put it in a repository later for versioning.
